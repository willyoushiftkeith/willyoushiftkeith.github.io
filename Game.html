        “KEET” you shout. Your Voice echoes around the fleshy walls of the Meat Canyon.
        Suddenly you hear a distant rumbling, you can feel the earth shake beneath your feet as great lumbering steps approach. Keith is coming…

<section id="01111">
        		You can hear him start to slowly walk towards you. He sniffs the air and the world grows dark as he blots out the sun above you. You look up terrified and see him looking right down at you. He opens his mouth wide and before you can do anything he swallows you whole

<section id="0113">
        		You slowly walk out to the middle of the canyon. There he is, the legendary Keith. He glares at you and bares his teeth releasing a growl. 
"Hello Keith, I am Michael Dolan. I come in peace, I only wish to look upon your mythical beauty"
The Keith is flattered and a hint of a smile flashes across his chiselled features. 
“Why are you trespassing in my home?” He asks.
You reply…
 <div class="slider--item">
 <a href="#016">”I want to kiss you keith, I love you now with all my heart” </a>

        		You slowly look out and see him standing there proudly in the middle of the canyon. The Magnificent Keith, his luscious hair blowing in the wind, His body glistening in the midday sun. You are transfixed by his beauty and lean out further to get a better look. But the slippy meat ground betrays you and you fall out from behind the meat

<a href="#0022">Keep looking further down the canyon</a>
</div>
    </section>
<section id="0021">
       	You press your hands against the meat to get some juice. The thick liquid slowly fills your cupped hands. You raise the liquid to your lips and tentatively sip at it. Its sweet and cold at first and you drink more freely. But as you drink more you suddenly start to feel your stomach swell as the liquid expands. Your whole body starts to grow and bloat as the meat canyon juice infects your body. You feel your hair grow thick and unstyled. A tooth falls from your mouth and you can feel your lower back grow hairy. You continue to swell and expand until you are truly gargantuan. You have become the keith, You weep tears of pesto and scream at the heavens in a mumble.

<section id="003">
        The walls of the meat canyon are tough and lumpy at the base and you make good progress initially. You hear Keith coming down the canyon so try to climb faster to escape. Soon though the meat becomes fatty and slick. You start to struggle to hold on as the midday sun beats down on you making your hands even sweatier. You reach up to grab onto a bit of gristle but the piece breaks off and you fall backwards. You tumble down and down into the waiting mouth of the hungry Keith.
