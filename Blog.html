A lot of travel, very long first day. So many planes but somehow time didnt fly #keithjoke. Arrived. Ate burgers. Next few days, Met new people and we ate waffles with maple syrup. They do really nice garlic bread here. Interesting to see how the garlic bread situation develops. Also need to source a retailer to buy pasta and pesto in bulk, getting worried i might have to try new things
Love Keith</p>

Im loving the garlic bread. Garlic Bread is always delicious but I've been blown away by how many different ways they do their garlic bread. Each Place seems to have its own style. Mind=Blown. Its autumn. Im in canada still, going to be here for the year. Hope you dont miss me too much Ireland.Â 
love Keith xx</p>

               <p class="slider--item-description">Dear Diary,
Had a terrible day. I was sitting at home alone eating pasta and then someone came into my house and started talking to me. I was petrified and mumbled angrily "who are you?" through a mouthful of pesto. Turns out i have a roommate and dont just get 2 beds in case i bring a girl back. Bit disappointed, the pressure to socialise with him may reduce my available time to watch all the TV and focus on my nutrition.
Love you so much, Keith</p>
