               <p class="slider--item-description">Since finishing college for the summer I have had a little more time on my hands. 
                 Apart from the day job as the phantom fapper I have been a little bored. I decided to return to my first love, Baking Quiches. The Irish Quiche Championships are in late August so I decided to get in practice. I started simple with some plain onion quiches to get my rusty baking body back in action. I started getting more adventurous though even going so far as to use some garlic. If youre interested I am now selling my quiches here on the website. Hurry up though, I might eat them all first haha. XOXO Gossip Quiche

Its safe to say I have become a legend on campus. I feel like a king. Everybody watches as i walk down the paths and everybody knows me as "the garlic bread guy". Guess my Yelp reviews of local garlic breads mustve gone viral haha. Thinking of maybe branching out and trying some Pizza at some stage during the year, we will see though. Might just play it safe. Ive got a perfect game going so why ruin that?
Thanks, Keith</p>

               <p class="slider--item-description">Dear Diary,
Had a terrible day. I was sitting at home alone eating pasta and then someone came into my house and started talking to me. I was petrified and mumbled angrily "who are you?" through a mouthful of pesto. Turns out i have a roommate and dont just get 2 beds in case i bring a girl back. Bit disappointed, the pressure to socialise with him may reduce my available time to watch all the TV and focus on my nutrition.
Love you so much, Keith</p>

Im loving the garlic bread. Garlic Bread is always delicious but I've been blown away by how many different ways they do their garlic bread. Each Place seems to have its own style. Mind=Blown. Its autumn. Im in canada still, going to be here for the year. Hope you dont miss me too much Ireland. 
love Keith xx</p>

A lot of travel, very long first day. So many planes but somehow time didnt fly #keithjoke. Arrived. Ate burgers. Next few days, Met new people and we ate waffles with maple syrup. They do really nice garlic bread here. Interesting to see how the garlic bread situation develops. Also need to source a retailer to buy pasta and pesto in bulk, getting worried i might have to try new things
Love Keith</p>
